      <p>One day, the boy didn’t come. Noon had come and gone, then 3, then 6. The sun streaked the sky purple and red. Her stomach growled in a wash of acid. It wasn’t until she stood, ready to go home that she noticed the pail hidden by a bush. She ate the food inside, and put it back where she found it.

The next morning, the same. She found the <span>pail</span>, filled, the moment she got there, but still she waited. He never came.
For days and days afterwards she waited. Biting her brittle nails with her wobbling teeth. Eventually she noticed the utter silence that encompassed her days.The children stopped coming to taunt her. The shops opened and closed in stillness.

She began to go crazy with the waiting, the worry, the fear that he would never come back, that something had happened to him.

The girl couldn’t take it.
One day, she went into town.</p>
