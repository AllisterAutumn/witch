By the time her father died, it was a race to eat food before it rotted in her mouth or her hands.
She knew she would die soon. If not from starvation then from the effects of her curse. The girl’s hair fell out by the handful, and her <span>teeth </span> were loose in their sockets.

The only thing the girl could look forward to in the endless days leading up to her death, was the daily delivery of food from her godmother’s son.

She thought about him all the time nowadays. If she was not waiting for him in the tightest anticipation, then she was mourning his absence in the deepest despair.
