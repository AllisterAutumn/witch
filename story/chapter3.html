The path back home was rocky, full of weeds, and dead. The grass grew coarser and drier until the ground was just dirt and stone. The trees leaned precariously on dead roots and cracked trunks. Their barren branches scratched along the blue sky like claws.
No creatures lived on that land, not even roaches or wasps. No vegetables grew there. No person could survive there.

And in the epicenter of this awfulness was the girlâ€™s <span>tin cottage</span>, small and pathetic, corroded with rust.
