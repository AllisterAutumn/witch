#The Witch

###This is an interactive visual 'game' that is founded on HTML, raw CSS, and javascript, and the US Navy and HelloACM Apis.
It's not really a 'logic' game. It is meant to be more like a visual storytelling experience....but it's also not a movie.
It's basically a 'Short-story-website'

######How to play: Just keep clicking ' the witch'

It is a witch website first and foremost, even without getting into the 'game' sections. Users have the ability to read articles, check the phases of the moon based on the date, 
get their fortunes and horoscopes told. 

###What I wish to do:
I would like to:
1. Add music and sound effects to certain sections.
2. Redo it in express so that the linkage can be easier.
3. Make it bigger with more sections.
4. Have actual articles that can be read on the site.
