   <p>And then the first rock was thrown, and then another. The girl never had a chance.
In the end, the town faded out around her body.
No one would touch it, for fear of the curse. She looked too alive. Her blood still pulsed. One might even say that she was just sleeping.

The foul air from her guts and acidic blood cleared the town in months, and even in death the grass shrivelled and died beneath her, and the buildings crumbled, and the animals fled.

And there the witch sleeps, <span>dreaming</span> of a better world.
