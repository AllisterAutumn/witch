Inside was a low wobbling bench that served as a table and chair, a mattress of rotten cotton and <span>feathers</span>, and a pile of stones, for stones were the only things that didn’t rot in her presence.

Many years ago the girl was conceived under the Hellstar Sepula and was cursed. She rotted her mother from the inside out, stealing her blood and eventually killing her from the womb. Years later, her father died in the tilted shack he had built at the edges of the town they had been driven from. As the she grew, her curse grew more violent. She was an anathema to the babies being born, and the old, and the ill.

But the townspeople didn’t forget the girl or her parents who had grown up in the town. Her mother’s best friend delivered baskets of food twice a month to the child who she should’ve been raising alongside with her own. Then every week. Then every day.
